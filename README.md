# weather_app
A Web Application made with the Flask web framework.

To get started, first create a virtual environment by using the following command:

```bash
$ python -m venv weather_env
```

Activate your virtual environment by using the following command:

```bash
$ . weather_env/bin/activate
```

Next up is storing your environment variables, in this case it will be your API key. To do this we will create a .env file, this type of file will not be committed to the git repository, and so, anything stored in this file will remain secure. Keep it secret, keep it safe.
